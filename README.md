This is a program to play with tilesets. See 
  http://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_aperiodic_sets_of_tiles 
  https://www.google.com/search?q=aperiodic+tiles&tbm=isch

Eventually my goal is to allow

-  manual design of tilesets
-  automatic generation of tilesets
-  manual tessellation the plane (fitting tiles together)
-  automatic tessellation

By combining automatic generation and tessellation, I am hoping to rediscover many of the classic tilesets listed in the wikiwand... and maybe some new ones!
